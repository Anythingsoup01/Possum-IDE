# Possum IDE

Using [Ferret](https://github.com/Anythingsoup01/Ferret), my application framework, I'm working on my own personal IDE.
This isn't going to be anything grand and probably won't have the most features, however I will be working on giving it all the functionality I would need from an everyday IDE.
If you'd like to implement a feature, go for it, make a fork and send a pull request, if it's useful then it'll probably be implemented & credit will be put in the source code, 
you can put it in yourself if you want it custom but be sure to not take too much space, otherwise it will not be implemented, that being said, any attempt to add anything is
greatly apprecieated!

Thank you for your support.
